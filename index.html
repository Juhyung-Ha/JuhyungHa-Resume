        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am Juhyung Ha, and I am currently enrolled in the University of California Riverside as a freshman. I am a pre-economics major; however, I plan to change my major to business administration. In school as a business major, I want to focus on learning about marketing and eCommerce. I personally believe that eCommerce is the future for many retail shops, and I want to get on board before it is too late. I am very hopeful that I come out the be an expertise in compelling advertisements as well as an efficient entrepreneur.  
I began having interests in business when I was ten. One day, when I was following my mom to her regular shopping days, I happen to be in contact with a big container with a hundred gumballs. When I saw the gumballs, my first thought was how much my friends would love this at school and I knew they were willing to buy some with the spare change they had. As a matter of fact, I was right. By the first week, I was already sold out of the hundred gumballs and students at the school were requesting for more. In a small span of a month, I have already cashed in eighty dollars from my so called ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù. Not only was I rejoiced to make allowance for myself, but the fact that I was able to connect with more students and how they were waiting for the product that I was providing made the process full of excitement. From then, I researched and ventured into many types of businesses that were suited for me.  As a young entrepreneur, some of the projects that I worked on include Amazon FDA, a Shopify store, and management in a Souffles restaurant. The most notable project was being a manager at ‚ÄúSouffles‚Äù. Being the manager at Souffles was a great experience because I was able connect with the customers as well as my co-workers physically and form a structure in Souffles which had tremendous effects. I recognized that I have a liking for providing services to people and guiding people to work together to provide the best results. My work experiences have led me to take a step into industry that I would love to be in for the rest of my life.
I can describe myself as a determined and competent worker that likes to challenge myself to improve every day. Some of best qualities I have are my sense of leadership, my extensive knowledge of my interests, and compelling story-telling skills. Through my experiences of working, I realized I love to create products that people can enjoy, and I also love to work as a team. Although I am easy going and amicable most of the time, I do not tolerate inappropriate behavior at all. I have a strong sense of personal justice and I do not fear confrontation. My qualities make me a strong candidate in management, and I hope to be a successful business owner myself in the future.
